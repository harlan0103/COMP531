                                        A late Houston Dynamo rally fell short in a 4-2 defeat to FC Dallas Saturday nightt at Toyota Stadium. Second-half goals from forwards Mauro Manotas and Alberth Elis gave the visiting Dynamo a chance late, but three strikes from FC Dallas after halftime proved too much to overcome.<br/><br/>
                                        FC Dallas took the lead early on when forward Maxi Urruti connected with midfielder Michael Barrios in the 10th minute. Urruti received the ball outside the penalty area along the right flank and quickly played a first-touch through ball to Barrios behind the Dynamo back line. Despite the difficult angle, the Colombian international placed a right-footed shot inside the far corner of the net.

Panelists from federal, state and local government — including Rice alumnus George P. Bush ’98, the Texas land commissioner — discussed the status of recovery one year after the storm made landfall in Texas and the long-term plans for getting people back on their feet.<br/><br/>
